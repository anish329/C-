Super Market Billing System in C++ â€“ File Handling & OOP

This project is a console-based Super Market Billing System built using C++, incorporating object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and file handling techniques. It allows users to manage product records and store them persistently in a text file.

Features:
Product Management: Add and view product details including ID, name, price, and quantity.
File Handling: Stores and retrieves product information from a text file (products.txt).
Interactive Menu: Provides an easy-to-use console interface with options for different operations.
Persistent Storage: Saves records to a file for future use, ensuring data persistence.
Technical Highlights:
OOP Concepts: Utilized classes, objects, methods, and encapsulation for a modular and structured design.
File Operations: Used file streams (ifstream, ofstream) to handle reading and writing operations.
Loops and Switch Statements: Enabled continuous interaction until the user decides to exit.
