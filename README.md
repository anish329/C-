Currency Converter in C++

The Currency Converter project is a console-based application developed in C++ that allows users to convert currency values between USD, Euro, Pakistani Rupee, and Indian Rupee. The project features a user-friendly menu to choose conversion options and displays real-time equivalent values based on predefined exchange rates.

Key Features:
Multiple Currency Conversions: Converts between USD to Euro, Euro to USD, USD to Pakistani Rupee, and USD to Indian Rupee.
Interactive Menu: Provides a user-friendly interface with options to select desired conversions.
Predefined Exchange Rates: Uses fixed exchange rates for accurate conversion results.
Error Handling: Includes input validation and appropriate prompts for incorrect entries.
Technical Details:
Language: C++
Concepts Used: Classes, Objects, Methods, Loops, Switch Statements, and Input/Output Streams.
Class Structure: Utilizes a CurrencyConverter class with methods for different conversions.
Encapsulation: Exchange rates are stored as private attributes, ensuring secure and efficient code.
Learning Outcome:
Improved understanding of object-oriented programming concepts in C++.
Gained hands-on experience with switch statements and input validation techniques.
Enhanced problem-solving skills by debugging errors and refining code logic.
This project demonstrates my proficiency in C++ programming and my ability to develop real-world applications using object-oriented principles.
